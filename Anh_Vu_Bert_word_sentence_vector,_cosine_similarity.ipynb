            "We've been meaning to try Bouchon the last few times we've been to Vegas, but for some reason we've just never nailed it down. We were able to stop for a quick bite right before our flight out. I think it was 5 o'clockish pm when we entered and sat at the bar. It was pretty quiet at that time but there was a constant in-flow of people as we ate. The bartender did a great job at setting us up to eat at the bar, almost makes you feel like you should eat all your meals at the bar! We ordered off the bar menu. Started with the Pate, which was excellent! My husband doesn't even like Pate but he really liked Bouchon's Pate. Since we weren't very hungary, my hubby and I split the open-faced lamb sandwich. What can I say, a ridiculously Awesome sandwich! The cut of meat was the leg of lamb and it was cooked perfectly. Nice clean flavors and the pommes frites (fries) were some of the best fries I've ever had and they give you a huge plate full of them! \n",

Unfortunately they use bar speed pourers as tops and of the 3 tables I tried, all were clogged.  I ended up just pulling the top off to finally get to the disappointing sauce sealed inside.  I wonder what other terrible industrial ingredients their meals hide.  Bland BBQ sauce did a poor job covering up their far from fresh day old meat.
