              "2  Moving to the Phoenix area was a shock to begin with and it has been difficult finding truly great Thai food establishments, especially in the far East Valley. However, of all the places I have tried, which is nearly 15 in just under 2 years, Papaya Thai on University Dr. in Mesa is the absolute WORST! \\n\\nI am a HUGE fan of all styles of Thai Food. I've traveled throughout Asia on more than one occassion, taught English in China and spent years seeking out authentic eateries in the Asian-based areas of this country's biggest Metropolitan cities. Thai food holds a special place in my heart, but never have I been as disappointed as I was with my experience at Papaya Thai!\\n\\nIf Papaya Thai was worth the words, I would gladly go into more detail about the atmosphere, the menu and the quality-to-value ratio, as I do with my other reviews... \\n\\nHowever, there's really not much to say about this dark and dirty hole-in-the-wall next to the Dollar Store. The service isn't worth the price...  \n",

The medley had no garlic and was sour.  The drunken noodles had no basil and after we asked the rude owner for some basil he told us that its in there but he will bring us some raw basil.  I think he must have been drunk to screw up 2 dishes that we have ordered 10 times before.  He treats the customer like an idiot.  \n",

              "1    There are several contributing factors to the 3-starness of Papaya Thai, but it isn't necessarily the food.   This place is literally a block away from my house, and I have ventured frequently because of its proximity, reasonable pricing, and portioning.  \\n\\nGiant fish tanks with some cool tropical fish are strewn about, but then there is this tank with the ugliest eel-like fish and catfish.  It makes it hard for me to eat looking at them, so I opt for seats facing the opposite direction.  I also feel like there are too many tables for the amount of space.  If the restaurant where ever full, I think I would knock into someone's head with the imaginary purse that I do not carry. \\n\\nNow onto the food.  I love that there are spiciness scales that I do not adhere too.  I always ask extra, extra spicy, and they don't just throw a handful of red chile flakes into the dish that I order.  Every curry dish I have ordered has tasted the way it should, not like coconut milk or peanuts.  The...   \n",
              "2    Moving to the Phoenix area was a shock to begin with and it has been difficult finding truly great Thai food establishments, especially in the far East Valley. However, of all the places I have tried, which is nearly 15 in just under 2 years, Papaya Thai on University Dr. in Mesa is the absolute WORST! \\n\\nI am a HUGE fan of all styles of Thai Food. I've traveled throughout Asia on more than one occassion, taught English in China and spent years seeking out authentic eateries in the Asian-based areas of this country's biggest Metropolitan cities. Thai food holds a special place in my heart, but never have I been as disappointed as I was with my experience at Papaya Thai!\\n\\nIf Papaya Thai was worth the words, I would gladly go into more detail about the atmosphere, the menu and the quality-to-value ratio, as I do with my other reviews... \\n\\nHowever, there's really not much to say about this dark and dirty hole-in-the-wall next to the Dollar Store. The service isn't worth the price...   \n",

The medley had no garlic and was sour.  The drunken noodles had no basil and after we asked the rude owner for some basil he told us that its in there but he will bring us some raw basil.  I think he must have been drunk to screw up 2 dishes that we have ordered 10 times before.  He treats the customer like an idiot.   \n",

Wow, was it worth it, worth the wait, Holy Cow!  We couldn't decide what to get, so we both got two.  The life changer is just that.  I lived in Chicago as a teenager, and USED to think a Chicago dog was the best there is...no longer.  Chili man's life changer is the best hot dog I've ever had.  Can't wait to go again.  I think he's right, my husband may have a problem with this, but I may be waking up in the night saying, \"Chili man, that's a life changer\"   \n",
